 # FLOWER BOY  

This is a project that was developed during our course "Graphical tools for interface design" - where we took a deep dive into designing a webpage from scratch and then handing it over to another group for them to develop. 
As such we of course recieved a design from another group as well - which is the project you are currently looking at.
This project took inspiration from the album cover of Flower Boy, and the focus is on a fun and playful design that is still responsive and has good accessability. 


## üöÄ Project Overview 

Our project is a fun and interactive webpage design with the sole purpose of letting users know more about the album "FLOWER BOY" as well as the schedule for the artists tour.

Our project features:
 - **Modern and accessible HTML structure**: Semantic elements are used to ensure clarity and enhance accessibility.

 - **Responsive styling with SASS**: The application is responsive, with mobile-first design principles supported by modular SASS architecture.

- **Modular and maintainable codebase thanks to Vue**: Vue was used as a framework to enhance code structure, ensuring a component based structer to aid in scalability.

 - **Team collaboration**: Our team used GitHub workflows, with each member contributing through pull requests and thorough code reviews to maintain quality and consistency.

### Animations
On start-page: The bees and clouds should move across the page harmoniously, maybe the flowers move with the wind. 

When the menu is opened it should slide in from the left (see prototype in Figma). And when closed it should snap back quickly. 

When the down arrow is pressed there should be a smooth scroll down to the next section on the page. 

### About the design
We took inspiration from the album cover of Flower Boy. We wanted to make a playful digital version of the album cover but in a more cartoonish style that feels alive. All the following design choices were made with this in mind. Based on that we have choosen a colourful palette that takes the user on a journey through the album. The font-style that we have choosen is a combination of the original font that is used on the album but with a more playful vibe. We have tried to keep the same style on all the buttons to ensure a coherent design across the pages.
