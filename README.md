## Animations
On start-page: The bees and clouds should move across the page harmoniously, maybe the flowers move with the wind. 

When the menu is opened it should slide in from the left (see prototype in Figma). And when closed it should snap back quickly. 

When the down arrow is pressed there should be a smooth scroll down to the next section on the page. 

## About the design
We took inspiration from the album cover of Flower Boy. We wanted to make a playful digital version of the album cover but in a more cartoonish style that feels alive. All the following design choices were made with this in mind. Based on that we have choosen a colourful palette that takes the user on a journey through the album. The font-style that we have choosen is a combination of the original font that is used on the album but with a more playful vibe. We have tried to keep the same style on all the buttons to ensure a coherent design across the pages.
